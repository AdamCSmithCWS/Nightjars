# Nightjars
Script, data, and models to compare trends estimated from simulated data for a targeted nightjar survey and the BBS.

The main script file "coni analysis with jags simulations general.r" inputs the four data files, defines and runs the hierarchical model used to parameterize the simulations, generates the simulated data, simulates the trend estimates, and plots the results.
